THE TORTOISE AND THE HARE

Once upon a time, the hare was making fun of the tortoise for moving so slowly.
The tortoise bet that he could win a race with the hare.
"Ha, ha, ha, you could never beat me in a race," said the hare.
But the hare thought it would be fun to show the tortoise how foolish he was to think he could win the race, so the hare agreed to the race.
When the race started, the hare ran far ahead of the tortoise.
The hare was so far ahead that he stopped to rest, and soon he fell fast asleep.
The tortoise did not stop to rest.
The tortoise kept up his slow and steady pace.
The tortoise won the race, while the foolish hare was still asleep.
When the hare woke up from his nap, he ran fast to the finish line, but he was too late.
The tortoise had won!
The tortoise knew that slow and steady wins the race.
Now, the hare knows it, too.

The end.
